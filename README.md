# RandomBlock Plugin

**This is the RandomBlock plugin made by me, Luckstern. A quick explanation of what it does is it replaces anyting placed by someone with a random block.**

Commands:
* `/randomblock [enable|disable]`: Disables or enables the random block replacement functionality.

Permissions:
* `randomblock.*`: Gives permission to all commands for the RandomBlock Plugin.
* `randomblock.randomblock`: Gives permission to use the `/randomblock` command.

**If you find any bugs, make sure to open an [issue](https://github.com/Luckstern/randomblock/issues). Also, make sure to tell me if you have any suggestion of features I should add to the plugin.**

**Finally, if you use this plugin in a video or showcase, make sure to use this link(https://github.com/Luckstern/randomblock) in the description or somewhere to give me credit.**

**Anyways, I hope you enjoy the plugin!**
